Hello, in this project I worked with Datastore to learn how to store simple data locally. To store simple data, sometimes using Datastore instead of Room can be a better option. In this project developed by Mohammad Nawas using Compose, a night mode option that the user can choose without depending on the night mode of the Android system has been added. Even if the application is closed, the current ui mode is saved locally with the use of Datastore, and when the application is started again, the application starts in the preferred UI mode.

Libraries, frameworks and services used in the project: <br>
ðŸ’ Accompanist <br>
ðŸ’ Datastore <br>
ðŸ’ Coroutines <br>
ðŸ’ Dagger-Hilt <br>
